      <h1>CloudOTP Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date: </strong>August 23, 2024</p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        CloudOTP does not collect any of your personal information through the
        server backend. This application completely stores all users' token
        information, encryption keys, backup data and other sensitive
        information on your local device. You do not need to worry about
        personal information being transmitted to external servers when using
        this application.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data storage and security</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All sensitive data is saved on the
        user's device. Local storage includes but is not limited to your
        two-factor authentication tokens, encryption keys, app settings, etc.
        This means that data is not transmitted over the network, avoiding the
        potential risks posed by remote server storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Encryption Protection:</strong> We encrypt all sensitive data
        using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), ensuring that even if the
        data is physically accessed or stolen, it is difficult to decipher. The
        encryption key is set and managed by the user, and only you know and
        control it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Access Control:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gesture Password:</strong> To prevent unauthorized access,
          CloudOTP provides a gesture password feature where users need to enter
          the correct gesture password to open the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database password:</strong> You can set a separate password
          for your local database to ensure that even if the device falls into
          the wrong hands, sensitive data stored in your application cannot be
          accessed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cloud backup</h2>
      <p>
        CloudOTP offers a variety of cloud backup options so users can recover
        data if their device is lost or replaced. You can choose to use WebDAV,
        Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, S3 or Huawei Cloud for data backup.

      <p><strong>Security of Cloud Backup:</strong></p>

          data to the cloud, CloudOTP will encrypt the data to ensure that the

          transmission process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud Service Provider Security Responsibilities:</strong>
          Although CloudOTP takes reasonable encryption measures, backup files
          are stored on the servers of your chosen cloud service provider, so
          you should know and trust which The security policies and measures of
          the chosen cloud service provider.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Risks of cloud backup:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Security:</strong> We recommend that you set a strong
          password and enable two-factor authentication for your chosen cloud
          service account to prevent unauthorized access that could lead to
          backup data leakage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data recovery security:</strong> When recovering data from the
          cloud, make sure you are in a secure network environment and protect
          your database password and gesture password during the recovery
          process.
        </li>
      </ul>
