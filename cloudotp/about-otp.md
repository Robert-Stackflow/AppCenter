# About OTP

OTP (One-Time Password) is a password that can only be used once. When using OTP, the user needs to enter a password generated by the token, which will become invalid the next time it is used. OTP is a secure method of verification because it is one-time use. Even if the password is intercepted, the attacker cannot use it again. This method is more secure than traditional password verification.

## Type of OTP

There are two types of OTP: time-based TOTP (Time-based OTP) and counter-based HOTP (HMAC-based OTP).
Of course, there are also other types of OTP, such as Mobile-OTP, as well as self-owned OTP developed by platforms such as Steam and Yandex.

### TOTP

TOTP is a timestamp-based OTP that has become the [RFC6238 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
It uses a timestamp and a key to generate a one-time code that is valid for a certain period of time and then expires. The TOTP interval is usually 30 seconds.

### HOTP

HOTP is a counter-based OTP that has become the [RFC4226 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226).
It uses a counter and key to generate a one-time code that increments the counter after use.

### Mobile-OTP

Mobile-OTP, referred to as MOTP, is developed by the [mOTP](https://motp.sourceforge.net/) project. It requires generating a one-time code based on the key and PIN code.

### Steam

Steam is similar to TOTP and is also generated based on timestamps, but its algorithm is different and the one-time code it generates is 5 digits or letters.

### Yandex

Yandex is similar to Steam, the algorithm is also different, and the one-time code generated is 8 digits or letters.
